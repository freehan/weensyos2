Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?


Exercise 5:
During the execution of process 4, the first known timer interrupt occur. 
When a clock interrupt occurs, the schedule() function is called. The schedule() functions is called, it finds the next runnable process and run it. So process 4 could not finish execution so it could not print out 4 on the screen.
